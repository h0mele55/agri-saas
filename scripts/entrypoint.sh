# ── 1. Apply Prisma migrations (idempotent) ──

# Pin the CLI version to match @prisma/client in package.json. If
# `prisma` is ever pruned from the image (e.g. someone moves it
# back to devDependencies), `npx prisma` would otherwise fetch
# `latest` from npm and could ship breaking changes silently.
#
# Prisma 7 — connection URLs are NOT in the schema any more (they
# moved to `prisma.config.ts` at the repo root). The CLI auto-
# discovers that config file from the cwd, so `--schema` here is
# redundant but kept for explicitness. The previous pin
# `prisma@5.22.0` rejects the Prisma 7 schema with
# "Argument 'url' is missing in data source block 'db'" — bumped
# to 7.8.0 in lockstep with the migration that landed in #140.
