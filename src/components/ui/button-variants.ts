/**
 * R19-PR-B — the shared liquid-carbon surface recipe.
 * R19-PR-C — added the micro-grain layer + the carbon-on-hover
 *            recipe for the transparent-background variants.
 *
 * Extracted from R19-PR-A's inline `primary` block so every
 * carbon-treated variant references one recipe instead of
 * duplicating the classes. The recipe is variant-COLOUR-
 * agnostic — every piece composes over whatever `bg-` the
 * variant paints:
 *
 *   • `--btn-carbon-border` — the meniscus edge, a token tone a
 *     hair darker than the surface so the silhouette is crisp
 *     without a "drawn outline";
 *   • `--btn-carbon-bevel` — the box-shadow that gives the
 *     surface VOLUME: a SOFT inset top-edge highlight (this is
 *     the "edge-light" — the bevel catches a hair of light) +
 *     a faint inset bottom bounce-glow + a tight outer drop;
 *   • a `::before` depth-overlay carrying TWO stacked images —
 *     `--btn-carbon-grain` (the micro-grain tile, top layer) over
 *     `--btn-carbon-overlay` (the soft elliptical light POOL that
 *     reads as liquid, bottom layer). Both sit in the ONE
 *     `::before` so they paint above the variant fill and below
 *     the label — grain over text would be wrong. `inset-0` +
 *     `rounded-[inherit]` tracks the button shape,
 *     `pointer-events-none` keeps it click-transparent.
 *
 * Spread into a variant's class array AFTER the variant's own
 * `bg-` / `hover:` classes.

/**
 * R19-PR-C — the carbon-on-hover recipe for the transparent
 * variants (`ghost`, `destructive-outline`).
 *
 * A depth-overlay over `bg-transparent` has no surface to pool
 * light on — at rest these variants stay flat and quiet, true
 * to their low-chrome intent. But the moment they gain a
 * `hover:bg-*` they DO have a surface, so the full carbon field
 * fades in: the same grain+pool `::before` (parked at
 * `opacity-0`, lifted to `opacity-100` on hover) carrying the
 * bevel shadow too. The border is deliberately NOT touched —
 * `ghost` stays borderless and `destructive-outline` keeps its
 * red danger edge; carbon emerges as DEPTH, not as a new outline.
 *
 * Why the bevel rides on `before:shadow-*` and NOT `hover:shadow-*`:
 * the `::before` is ALREADY opacity-gated on hover, so a shadow
 * declared on it inherits the hover gate for free — and the
 * v2-PR-4 motion-language ratchet bans `hover:shadow-*` outright
 * (hover-driven box-shadow reads as a decorative depth-lift). The
 * `--btn-carbon-bevel` is inset-led volume, not a lift; pinning
 * it to the `::before` keeps the whole carbon field on one gated
 * layer and stays inside the motion language.
 *
 * `before:transition-opacity` makes the carbon emerge as a
 * smooth fade rather than a snap; `motion-reduce` drops the
 * transition (the end state — carbon visible on hover — still
 * holds, it just arrives instantly).
