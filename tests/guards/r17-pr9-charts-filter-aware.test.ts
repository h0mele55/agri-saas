/**
 * R17-PR9 — Extend chart-filter awareness to coverage + evidence.
 *
 * PR-8 made the Risk Distribution donut react to `selectedKpi`.
 * PR-9 extracts the focus-or-dim behaviour into a reusable
 * `ChartFocusWrapper` and applies it to two more sections:
 *
 *   • Control Coverage (ProgressCard) — focused when
 *     `selectedKpi === 'coverage'`.
 *   • Evidence Status (StatusBreakdown) — focused when
 *     `selectedKpi === 'evidence'`.
 *
 * Three of the six KPI tiles now visually connect to a chart:
 * Risks ↔ donut (PR-8), Coverage ↔ ProgressCard (PR-9), Evidence
 * ↔ StatusBreakdown (PR-9). Tasks / Policies / Findings still
 * dim everything else; their charts arrive in PR-10+ if needed.
 *
 * Six load-bearing invariants:
 *
 *   1. The reusable wrapper exists and reads `selectedKpi` via
 *      `useDashboardChartFilter`. Future chart consumers wire
 *      with one prop (`kpiKey`) — no per-section duplication of
 *      the focus / dim logic.
 *
 *   2. The wrapper computes focus + dim with the same boolean
 *      pattern PR-8 established (`isFocused = selectedKpi ===
 *      kpiKey`, `isDimmed = selectedKpi !== null && !isFocused`).
 *      Drift here desyncs the wrapped sections from
 *      RiskDistributionSection.
 *
 *   3. The wrapper exposes the canonical contract DOM attributes
 *      `data-chart-focus`, `data-chart-dimmed`, AND a new
 *      `data-chart-focus-key=<kpiKey>` so future telemetry / E2E
 *      can identify WHICH chart any DOM node belongs to.
 *
 *   4. The wrapper applies the visual recipe:
 *      `ring-2 ring-brand-default ring-offset-2` on focus, and
 *      `opacity-60` on dim. Same recipe PR-8 used inline.
 *
 *   5. ProgressCard (control-coverage) is wrapped with
 *      `kpiKey="coverage"`.
 *
 *   6. EvidenceStatusSection is wrapped with `kpiKey="evidence"`.

// The whole chart-filter coordination surface (KPI tiles ↔ charts) has
